# Specifications for the Rails Assessment
CRM-Rails-App

Summary
My Rails project will be based on a CRM app where a sales team can keep track of their leads through the accounts they're managing.

Through this app, users will be able to convert their leads into customers which will then contribute to their sales total.

Ultimately, the goal of this is to see which user has had the highest earnings

Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
- [ ] Include at least one has_many relationship- User has
- [ ] Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y e.g. Post belongs_to User)
- [ ] Include at least one has_many through relationship (x has_many y through z e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
- [ ] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
- [ ] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
- [ ] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
- [ ] Include a nested form writing to an associated model using a custom attribute writer (form URL, model name e.g. /recipe/new, Item)
- [ ] Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include login (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
- [ ] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
- [ ] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
- [ ] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients)
- [ ] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [ ] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate
